##  Overview

<code>❯An intelligent email classification system that uses NLP and machine learning to automatically detect and filter spam emails with high accuracy.</code>

---

##  Features

<code>❯-Automated Spam Detection – Accurately classifies emails into spam or non-spam categories.
-NLP-Based Processing – Uses text preprocessing, tokenization, and vectorization for linguistic feature extraction.
-TF-IDF Representation – Captures term importance to enhance classification accuracy.
-Cross-Validation Optimization – Ensures reliable model performance across different datasets.
-Interactive Visualization – Displays confusion matrix, word clouds, and performance metrics.
-Deployment Ready – Easily integrable into email systems or web applications via APIs or GUI (e.g., Streamlit or Gradio).
-Scalable Design – Supports training with large email datasets like the SMS Spam Collection Dataset.</code>
